## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I acquired a better understanding of how different display properties affect the flow of the page and the positiong of elements. I also learned how to use the `@font-face` rule to host a font.

### Continued development

In the future I will transition to using grid and flexbox for page layout and positioning.

### Useful resources

- [Learn web development by web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) - Their courses on HTML and CSS helped me refresh my basic knowledge and reinforced in me the idea to use semantic HTML elements instead of generic elements coupled with a myriad of classes, which helped both the work process and code readability.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An extensive source on everything HTML and CSS.
